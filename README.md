# Travel to share
### - A platform for travelers and local organizations

#### History

I had this ideas for years but never had the tools nor the capacity to make it happen. Somehow, my interest for Python 
led me to a bootcamp in web app development which re-ignite the flame. Finally, I am going to bring it to life.

#### Overview

Basically, this web app is a free space for travelers to indicate their availabilities when theY travel and 
what they would like to share, e.g. a talk or a workshop; and local organizations around the world 
to indicate their interests and needs, plus their capacity to host a sharing event. 
For example, John is a Java developer working in Apple who is passionate about teaching programing to children. He is traveling to 
India with his family for 2 months. Jone registers in this website and updates his profile. When he has a travel plan 
he shares his travel dates and destinations. For instance, a local NGO in Pundicherry, Tamil Nadu 
could host 50 people in their meeting room and the local community they support would love to bring in a tech person for a talk. 
Through this web app they could easily find and contact each other. 
Some children in Southern India might have a new hobby or even a new direction in life after this free talk.

On the one hand, travels could use this platform to spread his/her ideas and share a few words with the local people. 
On the other hand, the participants of the event have the rare chance of meeting the speaker face to face.
Especially for remote locations and under-served communities, a talk or a workshop might plant a life-changing seed. 
It is a way of bring together the travelers and the locals; the experts and the students.

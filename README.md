# Travel to share
### - A platform for travelers and local organizations

#### History

I had this ideas for years but never had the tools nor the capacity to make it happen. Somehow, my interest for Python 
led me to a bootcamp in web app development which re-ignite the flame. Finally, I am going to bring it to life.

#### Overview

Basically, this web app is a free space for travelers to indicate their availabilities when their travel and what they can offer,
e.g. a talk or a workshop; and local organizations around the world to show their needs and capacity to host a sharing event. 
For example, John is a Java developer working in Apple who is passionate about teaching programing to kids. He is traveling to 
India with his family for 2 months. Jone registers in this website, update his profile and when he has a travel plan 
he updates his travel dates and destinations on the website. A local NGO in Pundicherry could host 50 people in their meeting room 
and the local community they support has interests in bringing in a tech related talk. Through this website, 
they could easily find each other through the matching criteria and contact each other.

On the one hand, travels could use this platform to spead his/her ideas and share a few words with the local people 
where they visit. On the other hand, the participants of the event has the rare chance of meeting the speaker face to face.
Especially for remote locations and under-served communities, a talk or a workshop might plant a life-changing seed. 
It is a way of bring together the traveler and the local; the experts and the students.
